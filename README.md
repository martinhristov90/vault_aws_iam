## This repository demonstrates Vault using AWS secret backend, running in EC2.

### Purpose:

### How it works :

- Terraform creates and provisions a one Vault server in AWS.
- There is not need to configure "root" access and secret AWS keys that Vault (AWS secret backend) is going to use for generating IAM credentials. Vault is going to assume a role by itself (EC2 instance profile), that has been generated by Terraform (roles.tf) and it is going to use it as "root" access and secret key (cool).

### Instructions : 

- Execute `git clone https://github.com/martinhristov90/vault_aws_iam.git`
- cd `vault_aws_iam`
- Execute `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`
- Connect to the address shown in the output of TF.
- Setting up Vault :
    - Initializing manually using : `vault operator init  -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1`
    - Unseal it with the one unseal key.
    - Login to Vault with the root token : `vault login YOUR_ROOT_TOKE_HERE`
    - Enable AWS secret engine : `vault secrets enable aws`.
    - There is not need to configure `aws/config/root` it is automatically going to use the instance_profile of the EC2.
    - In the current folder create a JSON file named `role.json` with the following content (this one gives all permissions to EC2 service when role is used):
        ```
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "ec2Admin",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": ["ec2:*"],
              "Resource": ["*"]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    - Create simple AWS secret engine role (IAM user) using : `vault write aws/roles/my-role-iam-user credential_type=iam_user policy_document=@role.json`.
    - Request a creation of brand new IAM AWS user by : `vault read aws/creds/my-role-iam-user`. Vault is going to return to you access and secret AWS keys that are valid for any (`ec2:*`) operation.
        > Note : If the policy document is not valid, Vault is going to create user in AWS IAM, and error is going to be returned, the user should be deleted manually from AWS console.
    - The key is valid for 768h (system default), to revoke it manually, execute : `vault lease revoke -prefix aws/creds/my-role-iam-user`.

## Security Notes :
- This is just testing setup, treat it as such.
- To use it in production, auth backend should be setup.
